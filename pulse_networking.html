    <h2>Energy-Aware Pulse Networking for Low-Power Wireless Sensor Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      <br/>
      Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) has opened up a wide array of applications where inexpensive sensor devices (nodes) with network forwarding functions can be seamlessly deployed across a chosen environment for continuous data collection about relevant system parameters over time. Structural health monitoring (e.g. in bridges, aircrafts, etc.) is one such domain where sensor networking has been proposed for maintenance-free continuous sensing and data collection. Such spatio-temporal data can be collated at a central location (called a Base Station) to create a holistic picture of structural health as well as infer and identify damage locations for appropriate and timely intervention. To create true maintenance-free systems, such sensor nodes should ideally be powered by energy harvested from the ambient conditions. Harvesting sources such as sunlight or ambient vibrations, though theoretically infinite in potential, can often be limited in rate of replenishment and erratic in availability. Thus, harvested-energy-powered sensing systems need to be designed with effective and efficient energy management built in.

    <h2>Research Objective</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      <br/>
      WSN applications such as Structural Health Monitoring often involve the need for transport of minimal information e.g. the occurrence of an event (as indicated by threshold crossing for stress / strain, specific crack / fault signatures etc.) and the location of such an event. However, for small-sized data transport traditional packet-based communication protocols introduce significant overhead through use of long preambles and other header information which comprise the bulk of the data transported. Since data transport is one of the prime energy expenses in sensor networking, the overhead in packet-based architectures can lead to significant energy leakage. Our research mainly focuses on developing novel architectures and relevant cross-layer protocols using discrete pulses as opposed to data-heavy packets for transporting event information efficiently and reliably across a wide variety of harvesting situations.

    <h2>Proposed Mechanisms</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      <br/> 
      In our research work, we have demonstrated that with use of a time-synchronized frame structure (as shown in Fig. 1), binary event occurrence information (yes / no) as well as event location can be incorporated within a single pulse transmission and its position in time with respect to the established time frame structure. Such a packet-less transmission scheme is shown to produce significant savings in energy usage while trading off some amount of delivery delay performance though remaining within application needs. Energy-awareness syntaxes have also been incorporated into the pulse paradigm for the system to adapt gracefully to abrupt changes in harvesting availability. Simulation studies have been used to validate the efficacy of the energy-aware pulse-based transmission in contrast to packet-based approaches. Application level results have shown that such an architecture is well-suited for embedded sensor applications in structural materials where energy for powering the sensors can be generated from structural vibration harvesting and communication performed through-substrate using ultrasonic channels via piezoelectric transducers.
      Through collaborations with teams in Civil Engineering at MSU and ECE at Washington University, St Louis, we have evaluated an end-to-end simulated workflow for continuous health monitoring and fault detection on an airplane stabilizer wing structure. This simulation considered through-substrate ultrasonic communication based on the pulse networking architecture and powered by vibration energy harvested from the substrate. A schematic for the simulation study is shown in Fig 1. Work is in progress to implement the evaluated pulse protocols in ultrasonic networking hardware powered by vibration harvesting. A prototype transceiver chip has been developed and characterization for the ultrasonic channel completed. Further work is also being pursued to incorporate node energy generation / consumption predictive mechanisms within the pulse domain which can modulate forwarding decisions based on the predicted energy landscape aiming to maintain network-wide energy neutrality over extended periods. The end goal of the broader collaborative project is to create a through-substrate embedded monitoring system across an airplane wing structure comprised of a network of sensing nodes powered by vibration harvesting and be able to detect and locate faults within the structure with specific spatial and temporal locality.
